# MyReads Project

The MyReads Project is the 8th project of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Progam. Using React, a bookshelf app is created
that allows the user to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/avnikolaou/MyReads.git

```

3. Install dependencies using `npm` command line tool

```
$ npm install

4. Run the application, again using `npm`
